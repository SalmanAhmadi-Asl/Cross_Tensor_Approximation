# Cross_Tensor_Approximation
This repository is a collection of MATLAB codes for the computation of the cross tensor approximation (also known as tensor CUR approximation). The algorithms are mainly based on the Tucker and tubal decompositions. You need to use some functions of the tensorbox version 2.4 or 2.6 https://www.tensortoolbox.org/, tensorlab https://www.tensorlab.net/ and tubal product toolbox https://github.com/canyilu/Tensor-tensor-product-toolbox to run the codes.
