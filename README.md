# Cross_Tensor_Approximation
This is a collection of MATLAB codes for computation of cross tensor approximation. The which are based on the Tucker and tubal decompositions. You need to install tensorbox https://www.tensortoolbox.org/, tensorlab https://www.tensorlab.net/ and tubal product toolbox https://github.com/canyilu/Tensor-tensor-product-toolbox to use the codes.
