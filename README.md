# Cross_Tensor_Approximation
This is a collection of MATLAB codes for computation of cross tensor approximation (also known as tensor CUR approximation). The algorithms are mainly based on the Tucker tubal decompositions. You need to use some functions of the tensorbox https://www.tensortoolbox.org/, tensorlab https://www.tensorlab.net/ and tubal product toolbox https://github.com/canyilu/Tensor-tensor-product-toolbox to use the codes.
